<p align="justify">This program is my submission for the second Algorithms and Data Structures assignment in my first year at Blackpool and the Fylde College.
The task given to students was to design an algorithm using Python (and the Pygame library) that deals and shuffles a deck cards, keeps track of a player's hand and to display the winner at the end of every round.</p>

<p align="justify">The program itself is a simple two player higher or lower card game where each player must predict whether their next card dealt will be higher or lower.
Each screen has unique buttons, backgrounds and sounds.</p>
